# CAN I USE IT?
Please be aware that this is not an official use template for writing your thesis.

# HOW TO USE IT
Please fill in the relevant information in the "main.tex" file.
Using the "chapters" or "sections" folders are highly recommended. 
Recommendations:
-Externalizing figures might speed up compiling time. (configure your compiler and the template accordingly)
-You can use multiple "*.bib" files and separate them with a comma in loader.tex in the relevant part. This is recommended to keep distinct bib files for different reference types.
-Make sure all the relevant fields of citation are present in your bibtex. Consult SBE's APA guide and natbib documentation.
-If you want to define new citation styles, do so in "SBE.bst" file.


# Why LaTeX?
Linguistics students might need tailored representations for language structure, 
language specific characters etc. It is also the nature of linguistics to present expressions 
in the language examined, with aligned glossing. These glossings need to be aligned with the words. 
Common text editors do not allow for spacing words according to the glossing. 
Also cross referencing to these examples are cumbersome with GUI text editors.
LaTeX provides solutions for each of the needs of a linguistics student.
