\section{First-level sub-heading example} \label{firssubsection}

Sub-headings are preceded by two double-spaces. There is only the usual (i.e. one)
double-space between the sub-heading and the first line of the text. Note that there
are two spaces following the number (\ref{firssubsection}) and the first level of the sub-heading.

\subsection{Second-level sub-heading example}

The second-level sub-heading, like the first-level ones, are preceded by two double
spaces. Similarly, there is only one double-space between the sub-heading and the
first line of the text. Remember to put two spaces after the number.

\subsubsection{Third-level sub-heading example}

The spacing for the third-level sub-headings, both vertical and horizontal, is identical
to those of the other sub-headings.
