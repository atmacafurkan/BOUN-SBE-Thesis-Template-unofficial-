\chapter{\MakeUppercase{THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A LONG CHAPTER TITLE THAT EXTENDS BEYOND ONE LINE}}
% make sure to use \MakeUppercase with your chapter names !!!

The chapter title above shows spacing of a title that does not fit on a single line of
text. Keep it all centered. In deciding where to put the line breaks, try to consider
`thought groups', e.g. it would be less suitable to start the second line with `title' â€”
the words `chapter' and `title' should be kept together because these two words
refer to a single concept.
Notice that the chapter title is, like the rest of the text, double-spaced. After the
chapter title, there are two double-spaces before the text of the chapter begins.
